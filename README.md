# SanChari

SanChari is a **real-time bus tracking and route management app** built with Flutter.  
It allows passengers to search for routes, view bus locations, and see previously taken buses â€” while conductors can log in, update their route information, and manage bus stops in real time.

# Features

### Passenger Features
- **Interactive Map** â€“ Displays available buses and routes based on your start location and destination.
- **Smart Search** â€“ Choose start location manually if location permission is not granted.
- **Previous Buses Taken** â€“ Quick access to recently taken bus routes (e.g., MF21, 25B).
- **Smooth UI** â€“ Draggable bottom sheet, clean design, and easy navigation.
- **Offline Friendly** â€“ Map and route search still work with manual input if GPS is disabled.

###  Conductor Features

- **Dashboard** â€“ View and edit:
  - Route number
  - Start and destination points
  - List of stops (add/remove dynamically)
- **Secure Auth** â€“ Integrated with Firebase Authentication.
- **Persistent Data** â€“ All conductor data is stored in Firestore so it stays synced across devices.
